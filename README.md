# Group Maker

> This app will provide a focused, streamlined, and yet flexible connection tool for new, introverted, or online-based students to find a study/project group. The primary goal is to encourage connection and collaboration among fellow students specifically at the same college in a way that is more effective than the tools which currently exist.


## Quick Start

npm install

# Install dependencies for client

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
