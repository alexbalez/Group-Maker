# Group Maker

> This app will provide a focused, streamlined, and yet flexible connection tool for new, introverted, or online-based students to find a study/project group. The primary goal is to encourage connection and collaboration among fellow students specifically at the same college in a way that is more effective than the tools which currently exist.


## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

http://localhost:3000  
or live at  
https://joina.group
```
IF RUNNING ON LOCALHOST, DELETE ANY .env FILES. Theyre only for the live server.
```
--- for testing ---

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

Admin module can be accessed by logging into  
username: admin@joina.group  
password: supersecretlongpassword
